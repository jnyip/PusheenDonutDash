Phase #3: Labor Division 
Pusheen Donut Dash
Jesslyn Tannady, Jamie Yip, Brenda Ji (J.J. Biebs)
CS230 Fall 2015

Contributions of each team members:

This was a collaborative process between the three of us. We had a lot of fun and it was great. 

Jesslyn worked on the GUI elements, including the timer, the donut queue representation, and the maze representation.
Jamie primarily worked on the Paode and Maze classes. 
Brenda worked on the Donut, DonutStreak, Pusheen classes. She also created the .tgf files for the maze. 

After everyone worked on their primary focus, we all came together to connect the components and thus worked a little bit on each file together. And thus, we have complete Pusheen Donut Dash!
